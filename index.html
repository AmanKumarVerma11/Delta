            <p class="text-justify">
                Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act.
                It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every 
                stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.<br>
                Over the course of your life, if you experience mental health problems, your thinking, mood, and behavior 
                could be affected. Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including: <br>
    
                &#9679;Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry<br>
                &#9679;Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse<br>
                &#9679;Family history of mental health problems<br>
                Mental health problems are common but help is available. People with mental health problems can get better and many recover completely.

            <strong><h1 id="Therapy">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</h1></strong>
            <p class="text-justify">Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on modifying 
                dysfunctional emotions, behaviors, and thoughts by interrogating and uprooting negative or irrational beliefs.
                 Considered a "solutions-oriented" form of talk therapy, CBT rests on the idea that thoughts and perceptions influence behavior.<br>

                Feeling distressed, in some cases, may distort oneâ€™s perception of reality. CBT aims to identify harmful thoughts,
                 assess whether they are an accurate depiction of reality, and, if they are not, employ strategies to challenge and overcome them.<br>
                
                CBT is appropriate for people of all ages, including children, adolescents, and adults.
                 Evidence has mounted that CBT can address numerous conditions, such as major depressive disorder,
                  anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and many others.</p>
